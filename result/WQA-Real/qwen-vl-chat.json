The scooter has a black seat and a chrome muffler, and the kickstand is holding it up while it is parked. The sidewalk is painted red and is located next to a street with a white line painted on it. The image also features a watermark in the top left corner, which is partially covering the image and making it appear faint."

The scooter's kickstand is extended, and the scooter has a small rearview mirror on the left side. The scooter's seat is black, and the body of the scooter has a few scratches and scuffs. The scooter's exhaust pipe is located on the right side of the scooter. The scooter's rear brake light is located on the right side, near the exhaust pipe. The scooter's license plate is located on the left side, near the front wheel. The watermark is located on the right side of the image, near the bottom of the scooter. It is a rectangular shape with a gray border and contains black text. The watermark is partially visible, as it is slightly covered by the scooter's body. Overall, the watermark is relatively easy to see, but it is not very noticeable due to its small size and the presence of other objects in the image."

The watermark is made of small, white pixels that are slightly blurred, making it slightly less visible than the rest of the image. Overall, the watermark is relatively faint and hard to notice."
